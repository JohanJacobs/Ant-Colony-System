# Ant-Colony-System
Base on the paper M. Dorigo and L. M. Gambardella, "Ant colony system: a cooperative learning approach to the traveling salesman problem," in IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 53-66, April 1997, doi: 10.1109/4235.585892.

# Class: TheAntSystem: 
This is the original algorithm discussed in the background section of the paper. Based on M. Dorigo, Optimization learning and natural algorithms, 1992.

# Class: AntSystem
The propsed algorithm in this paper.

# Requirements:
 - Used Effolkronium for random numbers: https://github.com/effolkronium/random

# General Nodes
 - Currently uses Randomly generated Node locations.
 - Ant start positions are random.
